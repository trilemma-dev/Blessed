    /// 1. To preauthorize rights by including ``AuthorizationOption/preAuthorize``, ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed``, and
    ///   ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights``  as authorization `options`. Preauthorization is most useful when a right has a zero timeout. For
    ///   example, you can preauthorize in the application and if it succeeds, call the helper tool and request authorization. This eliminates calling the helper tool if
    ///   the Security Server cannot later authorize the specified rights.
    /// 2.  To authorize rights before performing a privileged operation by specifying
    ///   ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed`` and ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights`` as `options`.
    /// 3. To authorize partial rights. By specifying  ``AuthorizationOption/partialRights`` ,
    ///   ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed``, and ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights`` values as `options`,
    ///   the Security Server grants all rights it can authorize.  The array of ``AuthorizationRight`` instances returned contains all the granted rights.
    ///
    /// > Warning: If you do not include ``AuthorizationOption/partialRights`` as an option and the Security Server denies at least one right, then
    ///         this function will throw ``AuthorizationError/denied``.
    ///
    /// If you do **not** include ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed`` as an option and the Security Server requires user interaction,
    /// then this function will throw ``AuthorizationError/interactionNotAllowed``.
    ///
    /// If you **do** include ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed`` as an option and the user cancels the authentication process, then this
    /// function will throw ``AuthorizationError/canceled``.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    /// As an example, to request rights needed for "blessing" a privileged helper tool:
    /// ```swift
    /// let message = "Example of a compelling reason you should grant authorization."
    /// let icon = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "logoWithLock", withExtension: "png")!
    /// let authorization = try Authorization()
    /// let granted = try authorization.requestRights([.blessPrivilegedHelper],
    ///                                               environment: [.forPrompt(message: message), .forIcon(icon)],
    ///                                               options: [.interactionAllowed, .extendRights])
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - rights: Set of authorization rights. These rights must be defined in the Policy Database. If the application requires no rights at this time,
    ///             pass an empty set.
    ///   - environment: Environment entries used when authorizing or preauthorizing rights.  The entries passed in are not stored; they are only used during
    ///                  authorization. If there is no need to modify the environment, pass an empty set.
    ///   - options: A set specifying authorization options. You can specify the following options:
    ///     - Pass an empty set if no options are necessary.
    ///     - Include ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights`` to request rights. You can also include
    ///       ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed`` to allow user interaction.
    ///     - Include ``AuthorizationOption/partialRights`` and ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights``  to request partial rights.
    ///       You can also include ``AuthorizationOption/interactionAllowed`` to allow user interaction.
    ///     - Include ``AuthorizationOption/preAuthorize`` and ``AuthorizationOption/extendRights`` to preauthorize rights.
    ///     - Include ``AuthorizationOption/destroyRights`` to prevent the Security Server from preserving the rights obtained during this call.
    /// - Returns: The rights granted by the Security Server. If you include ``AuthorizationOption/preAuthorize`` in the `options` set, this
    ///            function returns all the requested rights, including those not granted, but the entries that could not be preauthorized will return `true` for
